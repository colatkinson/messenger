{"name":"Pelt Messenger","tagline":"A UDP messenger written in Java","body":"Pelt Messenger is a simple UDP messenger written in Java. It is intended for communication over LAN. Like, you know, during a coding club meeting or something.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two modes of operation: a Swing GUI and a console mode. Both work in essentially the same way under the hood. Additionally, it can be run in server mode. This way, people only have to enter one IP address, and the server will forward on their messages to everyone else.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the GUI will be improved, and an Android app may be created because, why the hell not.\r\n\r\n##Development\r\n\r\n###Licensing\r\n\r\nPelt Messenger is released under the GPL v3, so it's freedums-tastic!\r\n\r\n###Contributing\r\n\r\nFork and pull request. Just try to follow the coding conventions already in place.\r\n\r\n###Compiling\r\n\r\nIt's in the form of a Maven project, so just run `mvn package` and run the resulting JAR file.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
