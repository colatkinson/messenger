Pelt Messenger
--------------
*For when sarcastic eye rolls aren't enough*

Pelt Messenger is a simple UDP messenger written in Java. It is intended for communication over LAN. Like, you know, during a coding club meeting or something.

There are currently two modes of operation: a Swing GUI and a console mode. Both work in essentially the same way under the hood. Additionally, it can be run in server mode. This way, people only have to enter one IP address, and the server will forward on their messages to everyone else.

In the future, the GUI will be improved, and an Android app may be created because, why the hell not.

##Development

###Licensing

Pelt Messenger is released under the GPL v3, so it's freedums-tastic!

###Contributing

Fork and pull request. Just try to follow the coding conventions already in place.

###Compiling

It's in the form of a Maven project, so just run `mvn package` and run the resulting JAR file.
